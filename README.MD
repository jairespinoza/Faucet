InterToken:
  -It mints an amount of tokens to be distributed, it also provides a set amount to blockreward for mining.
  
 Faucet:
  -It allows you to request for tokens, it also sets a timer to lock out of requesting. preventing non-stop mining for all the tokens.
  
  This project is unfinished, I have tried to test but I am left stuck to the testing of transfers inbetween accounts. 
 
 
 ISSUES WITH InterToken.sol:
  I had to leave out the mint function to owner since I can't perform functions within the constructor.
